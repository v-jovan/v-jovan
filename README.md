Welcome to my little GitHub corner! I’m a Frontend Developer with **three years** of experience building responsive, scalable web apps. Outside of coding, you’ll find me either mentoring, talking to people (or cats), learning new things, or *"pretending to be an athlete in the gym"*.

### 🔨 Current Projects:
- Working on my bachelor's thesis (so most projects here are *just for science*)
