# 👋 Hi there, I'm Jovan! 

Welcome to my little GitHub corner of the internet! I am a Frontend Developer with **three years** of experience building responsive, scalable web apps. I love exploring new challenges in IT, and outside of coding, you will probably find me either mentoring, talking to people (or cats), learning something new or *pretending to be an athlete in the gym*

### 🛠 What I do
- **Frontend**: Vue, Angular, Nuxt, React (I know the basics, but we can still be friends! 😉)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, Spring Boot, Flask, FastAPI, REST APIs (Yes, I talk to servers too!)
- **Database**: MySQL, PostgreSQL (Organized data => happy data; Happy data => happy me)
- **Other honorable mentions**: Python, Java, C#

### 🏃‍♂️ A *Bit* About Me
- Whenever I'm not coding, I enjoy being kept disciplined by doing sports and staying active! 💪
- The thing I enjoy is learning new stuff that can immediately be applied, and sharing knowledge-be it about code, how to do the perfect omelette (don't ask me, I still can't get it perfect :( ) - or some common fun facts
- 
### 🔨 My Current Projects
- Currently working on my bachelor's thesis, so most of the project here are *just for science*, for now
- I'm trying my best to find time to dive deep into React and Next.js!
- Always on the lookout for new tech to explore and side projects to dive into or improve things I already know 🛠

### 💬 Fun Facts
- I speak both **JavaScript** and **TypeScript** fluently (and a bit of human languages too, just in case - some Serbian, English, German).
- 🐍 I am a huge Python fan, but I'm scared of snakes!
- I can see that you're interested in my taste in music... Well my friend, let me introduce you to **Zdravko Čolić** 🎶
- **GitHub Stats?** Let’s just say my commits are better than my cooking! 🍽
